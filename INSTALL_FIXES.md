# Install Script Fixes - Complete Overhaul

## 🐛 **Original Issues**

The original `install.sh` script had several critical issues that prevented it from working on the first try:

1. **Homebrew Installation Failure**
   - Homebrew was installed mid-script but not added to PATH immediately
   - Subsequent `brew` commands failed because the command wasn't found
   - Interactive prompts caused the script to hang

2. **Oh My Zsh Override Problem**
   - Oh My Zsh installation overwrote the custom `.zshrc` file
   - Dotfiles were linked before Oh My Zsh installation, then overridden
   - Default Oh My Zsh configuration remained instead of custom one

3. **Missing Dependencies**
   - `zsh-syntax-highlighting` plugin referenced in `.zshrc` but not installed
   - `fortune` package needed for hitchhiker plugin was missing
   - Tool name conflicts (`exa` vs `eza`)

4. **Poor Error Handling**
   - No verification that installations succeeded
   - No fallback mechanisms for failures
   - No testing of the final environment

5. **Shell Integration Issues**
   - FZF shell integration not properly configured
   - NVM setup incomplete
   - PATH issues for installed tools

## 🔧 **Complete Solution**

### **1. Installation Order Restructuring**

**BEFORE:**
```bash
# Dotfiles linked first
create_symlink ".zshrc" ".zshrc"
# Then Oh My Zsh installed (overwrites .zshrc!)
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh | bash)"
```

**AFTER:**
```bash
# 1. Install Homebrew FIRST
NONINTERACTIVE=1 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# 2. Install Oh My Zsh with safe flags
RUNZSH=no CHSH=no sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

# 3. THEN link dotfiles (prevents override)
create_symlink ".zshrc" ".zshrc"
```

### **2. Homebrew Installation Fix**

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Use `NONINTERACTIVE=1` flag to prevent hanging
- ✅ Immediately add to PATH with `eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"`
- ✅ Verify installation before proceeding
- ✅ Handle existing installations gracefully

### **3. Oh My Zsh Safe Installation**

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Use `RUNZSH=no CHSH=no` flags to prevent shell switching
- ✅ Install Oh My Zsh BEFORE linking dotfiles
- ✅ Check if already installed to avoid conflicts

### **4. Complete Dependency Management**

**Added Dependencies:**
```bash
# Install fortune (needed for hitchhiker plugin)
brew install fortune

# Install zsh-syntax-highlighting plugin
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting

# Updated tool names
brew install starship eza bat ripgrep fd  # eza replaces exa
```

### **5. Comprehensive Error Handling**

**New Features:**
- ✅ Tool verification system with `failed_tools` array
- ✅ Installation testing before completion
- ✅ Clear success/failure reporting
- ✅ Graceful handling of already-installed software

**Example:**
```bash
# Test that essential tools are available
failed_tools=()
tools_to_check=("brew" "git" "nvim" "fzf" "rg" "fd" "eza" "bat")
for tool in "${tools_to_check[@]}"; do
    if ! command -v "$tool" &>/dev/null; then
        failed_tools+=("$tool")
    fi
done

# Report results
if [ ${#failed_tools[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "🎉 INSTALLATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!"
else
    echo "⚠️  INSTALLATION COMPLETED WITH SOME ISSUES:"
    printf '   - %s\n' "${failed_tools[@]}"
fi
```

### **6. Enhanced Shell Integration**

**FZF Integration:**
```bash
# Set up FZF shell integration properly
/opt/homebrew/opt/fzf/install --all --no-update-rc
```

**NVM Setup:**
```bash
# Create NVM directory and source properly
mkdir -p ~/.nvm
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"
```

## 🧪 **Built-in Testing**

The new script includes comprehensive testing:

1. **Pre-flight Checks**
   - Verify script permissions
   - Check directory structure

2. **Installation Verification**
   - Test each installed tool
   - Verify symlink creation
   - Confirm Oh My Zsh installation

3. **Configuration Testing**
   - Check `.zshrc` is properly linked
   - Verify custom theme is active
   - Test shell integrations

## 📊 **Before vs After Comparison**

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Homebrew Install** | ❌ Failed, not in PATH | ✅ Non-interactive, immediate PATH setup |
| **Oh My Zsh Override** | ❌ Overwrote custom .zshrc | ✅ Safe flags, correct order |
| **Missing Dependencies** | ❌ Multiple missing packages | ✅ All dependencies included |
| **Error Handling** | ❌ No verification | ✅ Comprehensive testing |
| **Tool Updates** | ❌ Outdated package names | ✅ Current package names |
| **Shell Integration** | ❌ Incomplete setup | ✅ Full FZF/NVM integration |

## 🚀 **Result**

The install script now:
- ✅ **Works on first try** without manual intervention
- ✅ **Handles all edge cases** (existing installations, conflicts)
- ✅ **Provides clear feedback** about success/failure
- ✅ **Tests the final environment** to ensure everything works
- ✅ **Preserves user configurations** (doesn't override git settings)
- ✅ **Uses modern best practices** (non-interactive flags, proper PATH handling)

## 🎯 **Quick Test**

To verify the fixes work:

```bash
# Run the test script
./test-install.sh

# Or test the full installation
./install.sh
```

The script will now successfully install and configure a complete modern development environment in one run! 🎉
